        <item>A crash and large fire along a California freeway involving an electric Tesla Semi has drawn the attention of federal safety investigators\n\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday its sending a team of investigators from the Office of Highway Safety mainly to look into fire risks posed by lithiumion batteries\n\nThe team will work with the California Highway Patrol to examine the wreckage and gather details about the events leading up to the collision and the subsequent fire response the agency said in a statement\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the Tesla rig was traveling east on Interstate 80 around 315 am Monday near Emigrant Gap about 70 miles 113 kilometers northeast of Sacramento when it went off the road and collided with trees near the right shoulder\n\nThe battery caught fire spewing toxic fumes and reaching a temperature of 1000 degrees forcing firefighters to wait for it to burn out the Highway Patrol told the newspaper The Tesla driver walked away from the crash and was taken to a hospital and the freeway was temporarily closed\n\nThe battery burned into the late afternoon while firefighters tried to cool it down for cleanup and the freeway didnt reopen until 720 pm authorities said\n\nA message was left Thursday seeking comment on the crash and fire from Tesla\n\nAfter an investigation that ended in 2021 the NTSB determined that highvoltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate\n\nThe agency which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations called for manufacturers to write vehiclespecific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithiumion batteries the agency said\n\nTesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022 more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles 800 kilometers when pulling an 82000pound 37000kilo load</item>
        <item>Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new information stealer thats designed to target Apple macOS hosts and harvest a wide range of information underscoring how threat actors are increasingly setting their sights on the operating system\n\nDubbed Cthulhu Stealer the malware has been available under a malwareasaService MaaS model for 500 a month from late 2023 Its capable of targeting both x8664 and Arm architectures\n\nCthulhu Stealer is an Apple disk image DMG that is bundled with two binaries depending on the architecture Cato Security researcher Tara Gould said The malware is written in Golang and disguises itself as legitimate software\n\nSome of the software programs it impersonates include CleanMyMac Grand Theft Auto IV and Adobe GenP the last of which is an opensource tool that patches Adobe apps to bypass the Creative Cloud service and activates them without a serial key\n\nUsers who end up launching the unsigned file after explicitly allowing it to be run ie bypassing Gatekeeper protections are prompted to enter their system password an osascriptbased technique that has been adopted by Atomic Stealer Cuckoo MacStealer and Banshee Stealer\n\nIn the next step a second prompt is presented to enter their MetaMask password Cthulhu Stealer is also designed to harvest system information and dump iCloud Keychain passwords using an opensource tool called Chainbreaker\n\nThe stolen data which also comprises web browser cookies and Telegram account information is compressed and stored in a ZIP archive file after which its exfiltrated to a commandandcontrol C2 server\n\nThe main functionality of Cthulhu Stealer is to steal credentials and cryptocurrency wallets from various stores including game accounts Gould said\n\nThe functionality and features of Cthulhu Stealer are very similar to Atomic Stealer indicating the developer of Cthulhu Stealer probably took Atomic Stealer and modified the code The use of osascript to prompt the user for their password is similar in Atomic Stealer and Cthulhu even including the same spelling mistakes\n\nThe threat actors behind the malware are said to be no longer active in part driven by disputes over payments that have led to accusations of exit scam by affiliates resulting in the main developer being permanently banned from a cybercrime marketplace used to advertise the stealer\n\nCthulhu Stealer isnt particularly sophisticated and lacks anti-analysis techniques that could allow it to operate stealthily It is also short of any standout feature that distinguishes it from other similar offerings in the underground\n\nWhile threats to macOS are much less prevalent than to Windows and Linux users are advised to download software only from trusted sources stay away from installing unverified apps and keep their systems uptodate with the latest security updates\n\nThe surge in macOS malware hasnt gone unnoticed by Apple which earlier this month announced an update to its next version of the operating system that aims to add more friction when attempting to open software that isnt signed correctly or notarized\n\nIn macOS Sequoia users will no longer be able to Controlclick to override Gatekeeper when opening software that isnt signed correctly or notarized Apple said Theyll need to visit System Settings Privacy Security to review security information for software before allowing it to run</item>
        <item>Ford has announced it scaling back its EV operations in the US after it claimed that customers are becoming more priceconscious and rangeanxious so Ford has made some huge adjustments to its future EV roadmap\n\nThe company announced this week that it has adjusted its roadmap for its US vehicles which will include a wider range of electrification options and longer ranges Ford is throwing away its next line of allelectric SUVs theyre gone now replaced with hybrid models that have shorter range but longer overall range when combined with the gas engine\n\nThis move will save the company at least 400 million reports CNN because Ford will need to write down the manufacturing equipment that it had to install to build the EV SUVs that it is no longer building Ford said that the change in plans could cost the company upwards of 15 billion\n\nFord will improve its battery sourcing and boost manufacturing efficiency to save on costs in the future with 30 of the companys annual capital expenditures will be dedicated to pure electric vehicles in the future down from 40 where it sits now\n\nTesla has been destroying Ford in the EV market in the US and across the planet for years now with the Ford F150 Lightning still the bestselling electric truck in the United States However Ford says that vehicles with hybrid technology are becoming more and more popular in the United States so it is deciding to pivot to meet customers needs where they are today\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in a statement We learned a lot as the No 2 US electric vehicle brand about what customers want and value and what it takes to match the best in the world with costefficient design and we have built a plan that gives our customers maximum choice and plays to our strengths\n\nHowever Ford will continue on its journey of making EVs albeit at a slower pace Fords next EV will be an electric commercial van that is expected in 2026 After that Ford will develop what its calling a groundbreaking electric truck codenamed Project T3\n\nFords mysterious Project T3 electric truck would introduce bidirectional charging so it can charge your home during a power outage and improved aerodynamics with Project T3 expected in the second half of 2027 Ford wanted to have Project T3 on the road earlier than that but the company wants to make improvements on battery manufacturing that will help reduce the cost of its new Project T3 electric truck when it arrives in 2027\n\nFords chief financial officer John Lawler told reports on a call that Ford would be pivoting away from its existing electric future and instead will push into its other platforms Lawler said What weve learned is that customers want choice and so were providing that choice with a full lineup of EVs hybrids electric gas and diesel products</item>

        <item>The muchpublicised August 1 electric vehicle fire in Incheon South Korea in which a MercedesBenz EQE spontaneously combusted and torched around 140 nearby cars has resulted in an immediate reaction from the Seoul Metropolitan Government The neighbouring capital city has announced plans to ban cars charged to over 90% from entering basement parking and restrict public chargers from charging EVs beyond 80%\n\nAccording to The Korea Herald the city government is set to amend its Guideline for Apartment Management Rules by the end of September including a new clause to recommend a maximum EV charging limit of 90% or less in underground parking lots While the said clause wonât be mandatory apartments that donât comply may be excluded from incentives or support programs funded by the city in the future said head of Seoulâs Climate and Environment Headquarters Yeo Jangkwon\n\nThe government proposed that owners manually set their carsâ charging limit to 90% Ensuring public compliance will of course be difficult so authorities are also planning to mandate carmakers to increase the current safety margin of their EVs the margin between gross and usable battery capacity typically around 3 to 5% currently to 10% This will grant cars a socalled charge limit certificate giving them access to basement parking\n\nStarting next month the government will also impose a charging limit on its fast chargers which will only let them charge EV batteries up to 80% This cap will be extended to privatelyoperated chargers installed across Seoul later\n\nUnderstandably the move has not gone down well amongst Korean EV owners and experts Korea JoongAng Daily reported Countering the city governmentâs claims that excessive charging is one of the key reasons for battery fires an energy science professor at Sungkyunkwan University has comprehensively ruled that out saying that batteries are designed to never be fully charged\n\nExcessive charging isnât the governing factor with a fire said Professor Yoon Wonsub who also heads a batterydedicated research center jointly run by the university and battery maker Samsung SDI EVs from the start are designed to never reach a full charge even if the dashboard says they are 100% Itâs an unproven argument that batteries carry a higher fire risk when fully charged\n\nAnother automotive industry source stated that while the cathode material of nickel manganese cobalt NMC batteries like the one installed in the burnt EQE possesses a maximum theoretical capacity of 275 mAh only 210 mAh is generally used in EVs This defines the aforementioned safety margin and means that even though a car says it is 100% charged thereâs still around 5% of unused capacity\n\nWe call this difference in the charging rate the margin in setting up the carâs durability said the source It is similar to a smartphone offering a battery protection mode that allows it to be charged up to 80% but shows that it is fully charged\n\nThe report points out that out of a total of 139 EV fires that have occurred in Korea over the past three years only 26 cases happened during charging according to National Fire Agency data Of the rest a total of 68 cases occurred while driving while 36 were started by parked cars\n\nIt seems a bit like a witch hunt blocking EV owners with cars charged 90% from entering underground parking lots Yoon said Itâs essential to come up with suitable countermeasures after a thorough discussion among experts\n\nOwners are also outraged by the governmentâs proposals arguing that such measures infringe on their property rights Imposing charging limits obviously restricts a carâs maximum range an important factor in buying and using an EV Netizens also noted the discrimination in which EV and internal combustion engined car fires are handled by the government\n\nIf petrolpowered cars catch fire will the government limit fuelling to 90% an Incheon Tesla Model Y owner wrote in an online community said to represent over one million EV owners in Korea I canât understand how the government came up with such numbers like 80 and 90 percent based on what proven data If itâs that dangerous why has the government encouraged people to buy EVs in the first place\n\nThe community was further incensed when it emerged the burnt EQE was not being charged when the fire started The exact cause of the blaze has yet to be determined\n\nSeoulâs governmentâs plans are in lockstep with its national counterpart which led by the environment ministry also aims to announce strengthened EV guidelines early next month Proposals include charging limits graded subsidies and forcing EV makers to disclose where they source their batteries</item>
        <item>A car expert recently doubled down on his claim that new cars hitting showroom floors are absolutely garbage in a followup video after stating that he will have to throw away his new Ford Bronco in five years\n\nTikToker and car enthusiast Nav Gill navsgarage first went viral when he claimed automakers are deliberately making cars worse\n\nIn the followup video he shares his opinion that the incentive for building longlasting gaspowered vehicles has been removed for various factors but especially because of new Environmental Protection Agency EPA regulations and corporate greed The video has been viewed over 13000 times as of publication\n\nGill cites multiple EPA regulations that he says can curtail production and innovation For example AP News reports that in March the EPA issued a new auto ruling to limit carbonpowered vehicles and shift the auto industry to make electric vehicles 56 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032\n\nNew cars hitting showroom floors are absolutely garbage Gill said Thereâs a few reasons Number one is EPA Number two is they want to make an insane amount of money If they force you to buy a new car every three to five years well they get to sell more cars in the long run\n\nCars are getting worse\n\nJD Power conducted a United States Initial Quality Study IQS showing that the issue of declining vehicle quality is more widespread than most people may be aware of\n\nThe automotive industry is facing a wide range of quality problems a phenomenon not seen in the 37year history of the IQS Frank Hanley senior director of auto benchmarking at JD Power said in a statement From persistent problems carrying over from the years past to an increase in new types of problems todayâs new vehicles are more complex offering new and exciting technology but not always satisfying owners\n\nGill believes automakers are deliberately making cars worse so people have to buy a new one every five years He also believes it is a deliberate move designed to force Americans into electric vehicles\n\nThey want to make these cars break so you are forced to go out and buy an electric vehicle he said\n\nAmerica canât handle going allelectric\n\nFor Gill the issue is not just about declining vehicle quality but also about sustainability He highlights this by discussing how new electric and hybrid vehicles purportedly strain infrastructure\n\nThe problem is we donât have enough power to supply electric cars for everybody he said\n\nUnfortunately for electric vehicle enthusiasts Gill is correct According to Gov Tech the US would need approximately 15 to 27 additional terawatt hours of electricity by 2050 to power electric vehicles Additionally the transition to more renewable energy sources will also cause strain on the electrical grid which will make it hard for people to adequately charge their vehicles\n\nIn the comments section many viewers agreed with Gillâs assessment of modern cars\n\nIâll NEVER buy that electric garage Iâll keep driving my older vehicles one said\n\nWe all should stop buying cars that we canât work on lets keep our old cars a second agreed\n\nItâs crazy how early 2000 Lexus will last longer than all the new cars a third added\n\nAnother suggested Lets all just drive modded 90s Honda civics\n\nThe Daily Dot reached out to Gill via TikTok Comments and Instagram Messages for more information It also reached out to Ford via email\n\nInternet culture is chaoticâbut weâll break it down for you in one daily email Sign up for the Daily Dotâs webcrawlr newsletter here Youâll get the best and worst of the internet straight into your inbox\n\nLooking to sell your car Sell it with Carro</item>
        <item>I saw a headline pop up somewhere about Tesla stock crashing today I donât watch the stock closely or check it often Once in a while I take a peek to see whatâs been going on But when I see a headline like that it catches my attention I googled it and saw that it was down nearly 6% today Thatâs not the biggest crash for sure but it would seem to indicate something happened\n\nWhen I looked around I saw that one of two things was probably the cause or I guess both of them combined\n\nTesla Finance and Business Operations Exec Resigns\n\nFirst of all Sreela Venkataratnam Vice President Finance and Business Operations Tesla resigned after 11 years in the company Given her role at the company itâs possible shareholders got especially spooked and thus sold some shares Itâs a good long post that you can read in full especially if youâve been following the company for that long But hereâs the paragraph toward the end that sort of explains why sheâs leaving As I take a break to spend quality time with family reconnect with old friends and focus on personal wellbeing I am energized for what lies ahead When the time is right I am hopeful that I will be fortunate to find another incredible opportunity like Tesla where I can drive impactful change and contribute to a meaningful mission with exceptional people As is often the case thatâs a big vague and we really donât know why sheâs resigning at this moment in time Maybe sheâs just ready for some time off Maybe itâs something else\n\nAgain the only reason I really see this could have caused the drop in the stock price is due to the level and division she was at in the company\n\nInterestingly in its story about this Fortune highlighted the LinkedIn post another Tesla exec Rich Otto Head of Product Launches published when he resigned in May Great companies are made up of equal parts great people and great products and the latter are only possible when its people are thriving Otto wrote at the time He then added that job cuts and changes in workplace culture had disturbed harmony at Tesla pushing him to leave the company Thatâs much more concerning than the almost entirely positive post from Venkataratnam But again her position in the company is probably what spooked investors a bit today\n\nTesla Semi Battery Fire\n\nThe other story that was making the rounds was one about a Tesla Semi battery fire A crash and large fire along a California freeway involving an electric Tesla Semi has drawn the attention of federal safety investigators AP writes The US National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday itâs sending a team of investigators from the Office of Highway Safety mainly to look into fire risks posed by lithiumion batteries\n\nWeâve seen stories about Tesla battery fires for a decade Weâve also pointed out that EV battery fires are much less likely than gasoline fires in conventional gaspowered cars However using that word again they still spook some people and in this case the fire took a long time to put out\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the Tesla rig was traveling east on Interstate 80 around 315 am Monday near Emigrant Gap about 70 miles 113 kilometers northeast of Sacramento when it went off the road and collided with trees near the right shoulder\n\nThe battery caught fire spewing toxic fumes and reaching a temperature of 1000 degrees forcing firefighters to wait for it to burn out the Highway Patrol told the newspaper The Tesla driver walked away from the crash and was taken to a hospital and the freeway was temporarily closed\n\nThe battery burned into the late afternoon while firefighters tried to cool it down for cleanup and the freeway didnât reopen until 720 pm authorities said\n\nI donât think a fire alone would lead to a stock crash However stockholders might have gotten concerned about an investigation from the National Transportation Safety Board I donât know I tend to think itâs more the first story that people were responding too and hence putting it first\n\nTesla Stock Changes\n\nFor a little broader context on Tesla stock though letâs note how different timeframes look In the past 5 days the stock climbed a lot and then crashed resulting in almost no net change\n\nGoing back a month things donât look as good with the stock price down 145%\n\nHowever going back 6 months the stock price is up 67%\n\nBut then year to date the stock price is down 152% As always TSLA is a volatile stock\n\nWhile temporary factors may make the stock go up and down I agree with Elon Musk that anyone owning the stock today really has to believe in Tesla being an AI and robotics leader and being able to financially take advantage of that in years to come particularly with robotaxis and humanoid robots Otherwise itâs just hard to see how Tesla could rise to an order of magnitude more sales and justify a market cap that is several times higher than other automakers particularly those that sell many more vehicles than Tesla In fact Teslaâs market cap is comparable to the next several automakersâ market caps combined Without faith in Teslaâs AI and robotics pursuits one would have to be betting on a massacre of legacy automakers as we transition to EVs more and more as well as Tesla dominating the EV market globally in order to justify such a high market cap I imagine Teslaâs stock will primarily hover around its current height with swings here and there for fun unless major investors start losing faith in Teslaâs new core work</item>
